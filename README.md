# AspectMatic

The Figma plugin that helps developers with aspect ratio calculations.

> [!NOTE]

> Do you use Penpot instead? Well, there's a [Penpot version](https://github.com/Jemeni11/AspectMatic-Penpot) too!

## Introduction

I built this plugin after learning about the CSS `aspect-ratio` property and getting tired of doing aspect ratio calculations manually. With AspectMatic, you can calculate aspect ratios instantly and format them in multiple ways.

## Installation

Head to [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1297912439687792545/aspectmatic) to install the plugin.

## Features

1. Separator Options: Choose between colon (:) or slash (/) to format aspect ratios.

2. Ratio Formats:

   - Regular Ratio: A simple division format for width and height, such as 300:9 or 300/9.
   - Reduced Ratio: The simplified version of the regular ratio, like 100:3.
   - Decimal Form: The ratio expressed as a decimal number, such as 33.33.
   - Rounded Decimal Form: The decimal ratio rounded to the nearest whole number, such as 33.

3. Aspect Ratio History: View and manage the history of calculated aspect ratios.

4. Easy Copy: Quickly copy any aspect ratio to your clipboard for use in your designs.

5. User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive UI designed to streamline the aspect ratio calculation process.

## How it works

1. Select Node(s): Click on one or more nodes in Figma to start the aspect ratio calculation process.

2. Choose a Separator: Decide whether to use colon (:) or slash (/) as your ratio separator.

3. Select a Ratio Form: Pick from one of four ratio forms (Regular Ratio, Reduced Ratio, Decimal, or Rounded Decimal).

4. Generate and Copy: Click "Get AR" to calculate the aspect ratio(s). Easily copy the results for use in your projects.

   This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

4. **Watch for changes**:

   To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

   ```
   pnpm watch
   ```

5. **Install the plugin**:

   - In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
   - Search for and run `Import plugin from manifestâ€¦` via the Quick Actions search bar.
   - Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.

6. **Debugging**: Use `console.log` statements and the Figma developer console (access via `Show/Hide Console` in Quick Actions).
